Purpose of this script was mainly to hone my web-scraping skills and understanding of how proxies and websites worked. Used chromedriver from selenium to do all the scraping and also undetected-chromedriver along with Amazon's exponential backoff and proxies to bypass site blocks and bot detection systems. 

The script was also used as part of a strategy in a case study competition to automatically generate scores for companies based on a linear weighted sum of 23 technical and fundamental variable to assist in fund managment. 

In the assets folder, there are some sample outputs of the script ( Nvidia ) and also the variables and the input file ( companies.txt ) in case you wish to check out the results or use it yourself. **Beware that since the chromedrivers are used, you must have chrome downloaded on your device to use this script. And this was also developed on a linux machine so keep in mind file paths may be different and other errors might occur ( Virtual displays ).**

I won't get into the exact reasoning behind the scoring but do not use this as any sort of financial advice if you plan to test out the script!
